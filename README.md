Kubebuilder tutorial CronJobs &lt;https://book.kubebuilder.io/cronjob-tutorial/cronjob-tutorial.html>

This is just an outcome of the tutorial I followed to learn about how to create a custom controller in a kubernetes cluster.

You probable need:
- Minikube
- Golang 1.13.
- Cert-manager 0.11.0 or higher.


TODO:
Still there are some hardcoded pieces in it that needs some attention. (webhook-certificate-dns/ca-injection)
Could not find a way to dynamically let kustomize do it, ... yet :)
